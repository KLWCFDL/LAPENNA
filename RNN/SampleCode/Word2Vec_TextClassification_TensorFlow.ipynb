For example, a word embedding lexicon may provide a 100-number vector for each word in the English dictionary. Word2vec is one such embedding.\n","\n","Word2vec is implemented by shallow, two-layer neural networks that trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus assigned a corresponding vector in high dimension space. Similar words will have similar vectors in this high dimension space.[[Cite:mikolov2013efficient]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)\n","\n","### Suggested Software for Word2Vec\n","\n","The following URLs provide useful software and data for working with Word2vec.\n","\n","* [GoogleNews Vectors](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/), [GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors)\n","* [Python Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)\n","\n","The Python package Gensim is used in this chapter to work with word2vec vectors.
