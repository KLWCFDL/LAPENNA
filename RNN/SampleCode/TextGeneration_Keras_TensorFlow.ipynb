You can use similar technology to complete sentences when a user is entering text.  Simply the ability to output free-form text becomes the foundation of many other technologies.

The LSTM is learning to construct its own words without even being shown what a word is.  We will begin with character-level text generation.  In the next module, we will see how we can use nearly the same technique to operate at the word level.  We will implement word-level automatic captioning in the next module.\n",
