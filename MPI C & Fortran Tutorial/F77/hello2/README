***---> readme file for the hello2.f file/exercise <---***

This is a simple hello world exercise using MPI.  To go
through the exercise as it is done during the lab session:

1)  cp hello2.f.template hello2.f

2)  Pull the file hello2.f up in your favorite text editor
    and replace the XXXXXXXX's in the MPI calls with the
    correct text.

3)  Compile and run the code.

When compiled and run correctly the host process will send a 
copy of the following message to each spawned process, which 
will then print it to the screen.

Process n:  Hello World!

where n is between 1 and N-1, and N is the number of processes
requested when submitting the executable.
