***---> readme file for the matmul.c file/exercise <---***

  In this code the equation [M] = [C] + [A]*[B] is solved.
The major kernel in this code and the focus of the
exercise is the matrix-matrix multiplication.  In the
parallel version of the code this is carried out in a
distributed manner.  The master distributes the system
among the workers who perform the actual multiplication in
smaller blocks and then send back their respective results
to the master.
NOTE:  The C and F77 versions of the code differ slightly
due to the way matrices are stored.  In C matrices are
stored in row-major order while F77 arrays are stored in
column-major order.
