***---> readme file for the mpi_timing.c file/exercise <---***

In this exercise two processes pass messages of varying 
lengthes backand forth a number of times.  Timings are made
for each message before it is sent and after it is received
back.  The difference is computed to obtain the actual
communication time.  Finally the average communication time
and the bandwidth are calculated and output to the screen.
When compiled and run correctly the output should look
similar to the following:

  Doing round trip test for:
  Message length = 1 integer value(s)
  Message size   = 4 Bytes
  Number of Reps = 20
  *** Round Trip Avg = 0.000670 Sec
  *** Bandwidth = 11935.844834 Byte/Sec


  Doing round trip test for:
  Message length = 100 integer value(s)
  Message size   = 400 Bytes
  Number of Reps = 20
  *** Round Trip Avg = 0.000808 Sec
  *** Bandwidth = 989547.900331 Byte/Sec


  Doing round trip test for:
  Message length = 10000 integer value(s)
  Message size   = 40000 Bytes
  Number of Reps = 20
  *** Round Trip Avg = 0.009659 Sec
  *** Bandwidth = 8282473.767819 Byte/Sec


  Doing round trip test for:
  Message length = 1000000 integer value(s)
  Message size   = 4000000 Bytes
  Number of Reps = 20
  *** Round Trip Avg = 0.844571 Sec
  *** Bandwidth = 9472269.103376 Byte/Sec
