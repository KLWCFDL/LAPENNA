This is a basic introduction to MPI. The provided
program is 99% complete less a couple lines
of code for a print out.

Set up the process of rank 0 prints a *special*
message.

For all other nodes, print the rank and size.

Review all the MPI function calls and understand
what they are doing. Your goal should be to take
the knowledge learned with this simple program
and code the other programs included in this lab
knowing what MPI function is needed.
