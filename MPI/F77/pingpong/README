In this code two processes send packets of information back and
forth a number of times and record the amount of time required.
The packets of information consist of an array of dummy integer
values which vary in length from one integer value to 10,001
integer values.  These packets are sent back and forth from one
process to another 100 times and the total amount of time
required is recorded.  From this timing data the average amount
of time per send/receive is computed as well as the transfer
rate (bandwidth) in bytes/sec.  The output should look something
like the following:

length   time/message (sec)    transfer rate (byte/sec)
