***---> readme file for the array.c file/exercise <---***

This code performs a simple manipulation on an array of numbers.
The master process initializes an array of numbers and then
distributes it in chunks to the worker processes.  The worker
processes add 1 to all entries of their chunk of the array and
then send it back to the master.  The master displays a few 
entries of the updated matrix.
